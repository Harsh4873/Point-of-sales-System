## Training

Manager PIN Access :: 1234

Our system requires minor training that will allow employees to be very efficient. A pin is required on entry to ensure security between tab navigation. Each button press represents a size (S,M,L). Small always corresponds with blue, medium always corresponds with green, and large always corresponds with orange. In the event that a bowl, plate, or bigger plate is detected the system will treat the button presses as a count of that item. There are many input validation checks that allow for bowls, plates, bigger plates, and a la carte options to be added with ease. For example if one entree and one side are selected the system will recognize that as a bowl. This carries for all items as the system is smart enough to realize what has been selected. Once all of the items of a single order have been added it should be added to the order with the plus button. Once all items in an order have been added the employee should access the order button and allow for paying items out. Items can be removed if they are clicked on in the order tab. Once the pay button is hit the entire order is cleared and sent to inventory and order history.
